# Scratchings for a latency article

## Getting started

Requirements:

1. postgres
2. a database called `latency`
3. postgis extension installed in that database
4. Python 3
5. the stuff in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

Then run:

```
make
```

If you just want to see what I did, consult the [makefile](Makefile).
